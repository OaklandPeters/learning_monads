* [med] Decide if this is a useful distinction to make: in the context of functors, draw the following distinction - (1) morphisms in the codomain (C.a->C.b), vs (2) F(D.a->D.b) ~= (C.a -> C.b) morphisms which are the result of mapping a morphism from the domain D into codomain C via morphism F. In this construction, this might be represented via a FunctorCategory, which is a subcategory ~ subclass of the codomain C.
