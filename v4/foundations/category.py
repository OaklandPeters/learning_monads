Difference in terms:
----------------------
In category-theory, what is called the *objects* in a category, we are calling the *elements* of a category - to prevent name-collusions (and confusions) with Pythons builtin 'object' class.
Note - Python's 'object' class, actually forms the 'elements' for the category of all objects representable in Python (which I'm calling Pysk).
