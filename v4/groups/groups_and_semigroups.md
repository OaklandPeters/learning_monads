Groups and SemiGroups
===========================================


The Distinction of Totality
---------------------------------
Semigroup (used by Monoids) is very similar to Semicategory (used by Categories),
except for one very crucial difference. Semigroups, and therefore Monoids, are
total - meaning that their binary operation can be applied on *any* two
elements.

Examples
------------
For example, with IntegerAddition (a monoid) you can add any two
integers together. However, in Pysk, the Category of composing Python functions,
not all functions can be composed - for example: a function on integers and a
function on strings.

PROBLEM: This group-theory construction of Category (which has only identity+compose), classhes with my definition of Category (Element+Morphism+compose+identity+call+apply)

Morphisms VS Elements
------------------------
Usually, we will be using Group-related terms to refer to Elements in some structure (usually a category), and Category-related terms to refer to Morphisms on those Elements.

Groups
--------
SemiGroup
Zeroable
Monoid
Group


Categorys
------------
Composable
Identifiable
Category
Groupoid  (This needs a new name)
