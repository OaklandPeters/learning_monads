Category-Theory Library
===========================
The idea of this library is to have a rigorous representation of Haskell-inspired 
Category and Group theory concepts. However, the objects should be both usable
and reasonably idiomatic in Python. Particularly, the naming should be more reasonable
than Haskell usually is, and should reflect Pythonic naming conventions - particularly
magic-methods and collections.abc.
